## About

Welcome to the `wallet app`, an **open-source** Solana wallet designed for the Helium ecosystem. With this app, you can manage your accounts and identity on the Helium network, view transactions, import multiple accounts, and even vote.

The app also comes with a handy address book, allowing you to save commonly used wallet addresses for quick access. Plus, you can send multiple Helium currencies to multiple recipients simultaneously.

You can also view and claim hotspot rewards within the app, as well as explore various dApps with the embedded browser.

We hope you enjoy using the wallet app and all of its convenient features!

## Usage

**Important: All the commands should be run at the root of the repo.**

### Tools

Our [**React Native app**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) is built using [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and utilizes the [**Shopify/Restyle**](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle) library for styling. We manage our dependencies using [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/), a fast and reliable package manager. Shopify/Restyle provides a set of pre-built UI components and style primitives, making it easy to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces. It offers a great starting point for building a custom UI, while also offering the flexibility to customize and extend the existing components.
